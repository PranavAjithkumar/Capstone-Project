1) Introduction/Business Problem
The business problem will be to use the Foursquare API data to find which areas are populated the most and form predictions on upcoming areas. For example, if a certain area gets a lot of housing developments, therefore nearby areas should be able to use that attention to build up their market. The foursquare api will be used to find which areas are most populated in toronta and from there figure out where to form the next business. This data would be useful to the client, as it would tell them which areas are beneficial for business. They could put ads around the area or if they are looking to relocate or start their business, it would allow them to judge the area accordingingly 

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/
This link will be used to find neighborhood to find most populated areas

By using this data , a predicitive model may be able to be formed to find the areas where population is high, hence businesses could prosper. This data will show the correlation between prospering areas and neighborhoods and can be used to help clients find where the best business can be found.
