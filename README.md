# Capstone-Project

1) Introduction/Business Problem
The business problem will be to use the Foursquare API data to find which areas are populated the most and form predictions on upcoming areas. For example, if a certain area gets a lot of customers, therefore nearby areas should be able to use that attention to build up their market. The foursquare api will be used to find which areas are most populated in toronta and from there figure out where to form the next business. 

2) Downloading and Prepping Data
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/business-improvement-areas/
This link will be used to find areas where businesses are starting and growing. 

https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/
This link will be used to find neighborhood to find most populated areas

By combining the two data, a predicitive model may be able to be formed to find the next area where businesses could prosper.
